                                            period of 3-12 months, depending on the volume created.<br> The credit loans are a great benefit, but it is important to note that it is not demo money! All credit consists of the company's own funds and it is expected of all
                                            clients to use it wisely, with caution and low risk.<br> Thank you for the vote of confidence.<br><br>

                                            <h7 class="font-weight-600">SUMMARY OF THE Q&amp;A AMENDMENTS:</h7> <br><br>

                                            <h7 class="font-weight-600"> 1) Use of trading benefits when offering CFDs or other speculative products;</h7> <br>
                                            <strong>ESMA recommendation:</strong> the practice of offering bonuses must be avoided; including benefits that are designed to encourage behaviours that are not in the best interests of clients. <br><br>

                                            <h7 class="font-weight-600"> 2) Withdrawal of funds from trading accounts when investing in CFDs or other speculative products;</h7> <br>
                                            <strong>ESMA recommendation:</strong>  The firm (the Merchant) should enable its clients to withdraw funds from their trading account at any time. <br> Ordinarily, in the case that there is a positive cash balance in the retail
                                            client’s trading account that is not committed margin supporting open positions, this should mean that a firm is able to process the client’s request to withdraw funds (e.g. by sending payment instruction to the bank) on the
                                            same day that the request to withdraw funds was made, or the next working day if the client’s request is received outside of normal trading hours. <br><br>

                                            <h7 class="font-weight-600"> 3) Use of leverage when offering CFDs or other leveraged products to retail clients;</h7> <br>
                                            <strong>ESMA recommendation:</strong>  The firm (the Merchant) must: <br> (a) Recommend that the client does not dedicate his or her entire deposit to meeting margin requirements, in order to protect the client against market
                                            volatility; and <br> (b)   Give clients the option to lower the leverage in order to limit their exposure. The maximum possible leverage limit should not be offered as the default offer to retail clients. <br><br>

                                            <h7 class="font-weight-600"> 4) Best execution obligations for firms offering CFDs or other speculative products to retail clients</h7> <br>
                                            <strong>ESMA recommendation:</strong>  The Merchant must have an execution policy with certain content. The firm (the Merchant) must not: <br> (a) attempt to exclude or limit best execution responsibilities, or <br> (b) attempt
                                            to transfer best execution responsibilities to another party,  through clauses in retail client agreements, contracts, or in the firm’s execution policy; <br> (c) use poorly defined clauses to arbitrarily cancel (usually profitable)
                                            client trades. <br><br>

                                            <h7 class="font-weight-600">LEGAL AGE</h7> <br> The Company’s services and products traded are only available to individuals who are at least 18 years old (and at least the legal age in your jurisdiction). You represent and warrant that if you are an
